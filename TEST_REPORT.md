# SSH Test Server v1.0.2 - Test Report

## Executive Summary

Testing completed for SSH Test Server v1.0.2 release. The GitHub Actions workflow has been updated to build both Alpine and Debian variants with proper tagging. Documentation has been corrected to reflect the actual GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) paths.

## Current Status

### ✅ Available Tags (Production)
- `ghcr.io/billchurch/ssh_test:latest` - EXISTS (Debian, default)
- `ghcr.io/billchurch/ssh_test:v1.0.2` - EXISTS
- `ghcr.io/billchurch/ssh_test:v1.0.1` - EXISTS
- `ghcr.io/billchurch/ssh_test:1.0.2` - EXISTS (without 'v' prefix)
- `ghcr.io/billchurch/ssh_test:1.0.1` - EXISTS
- `ghcr.io/billchurch/ssh_test:main` - EXISTS (development)

### ❌ Missing Tags (To be created after workflow update)
- `ghcr.io/billchurch/ssh_test:alpine` - NOT FOUND
- `ghcr.io/billchurch/ssh_test:debian` - NOT FOUND  
- `ghcr.io/billchurch/ssh_test:v1.0.2-alpine` - NOT FOUND
- `ghcr.io/billchurch/ssh_test:v1.0.2-debian` - NOT FOUND

## Changes Made

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow (`build-and-push.yml`)
- ✅ Added matrix strategy to build both Alpine and Debian variants
- ✅ Configured proper tagging with variant suffixes
- ✅ Set up variant-specific latest tags (`alpine`, `debian`)
- ✅ Ensured `latest` tag points to Debian for backward compatibility
- ✅ Added variant-specific caching and SBOM generation
- ✅ Updated test matrix to test both variants

### 2. Documentation Updates (`README.md`)
- ✅ Fixed all image references from `ssh-test-server` to `ghcr.io/billchurch/ssh_test`
- ✅ Updated Quick Start examples with correct GHCR paths
- ✅ Added variant-specific pull examples
- ✅ Clarified that `latest` equals Debian variant

### 3. Docker Compose Examples (`examples/docker-compose.yml`)
- ✅ Removed local build configurations
- ✅ Updated all services to use GHCR images
- ✅ Maintained all existing profiles and configurations

## Local Testing Results

### Build Tests
```
✅ Debian variant: Successfully built (118MB)
✅ Alpine variant: Successfully built (13.8MB)
```

### Runtime Tests
```
✅ Debian container: Started, health check passed, SSH port accessible
✅ Alpine container: Started, health check passed, SSH port accessible
```

## Expected Behavior After Deployment

Once the updated workflow runs (on next push to main or manual trigger), the following tags will be created:

### For Each Release (e.g., v1.0.3)
- `ghcr.io/billchurch/ssh_test:v1.0.3` (Debian)
- `ghcr.io/billchurch/ssh_test:v1.0.3-debian`
- `ghcr.io/billchurch/ssh_test:v1.0.3-alpine`
- `ghcr.io/billchurch/ssh_test:1.0.3` (Debian, without 'v')
- `ghcr.io/billchurch/ssh_test:1.0.3-debian`
- `ghcr.io/billchurch/ssh_test:1.0.3-alpine`

### Latest Tags
- `ghcr.io/billchurch/ssh_test:latest` (Debian)
- `ghcr.io/billchurch/ssh_test:debian` (latest Debian)
- `ghcr.io/billchurch/ssh_test:alpine` (latest Alpine)

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Commit and push these changes to trigger the workflow
   - Monitor the GitHub Actions run to ensure both variants build successfully
   - Verify all expected tags are created in GHCR

2. **Post-Deployment Testing**
   - Pull and test each new variant tag
   - Verify multi-architecture support (amd64/arm64)
   - Run integration tests against published images

3. **Documentation Enhancement**
   - Consider adding a migration guide for users moving from Docker Hub
   - Add troubleshooting section for common GHCR authentication issues

## Size Comparison

| Variant | Size | Use Case |
|---------|------|----------|
| Alpine | 13.8MB | Minimal footprint, Kubernetes, CI/CD |
| Debian | 118MB | Maximum compatibility, development |

## Conclusion

The SSH Test Server v1.0.2 infrastructure has been successfully updated to support dual-variant builds with proper tagging. The workflow changes ensure both Alpine and Debian variants will be available with clear, consistent tagging conventions. Documentation has been corrected to reflect the actual registry location (GHCR instead of Docker Hub).
